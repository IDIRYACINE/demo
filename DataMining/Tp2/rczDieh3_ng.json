(And how he counts as \"manly\" or cool or whatever in anime fandom is the worst joke ever.)\nSort of like the idiocy of the (mediocre and overrated anyway) Attack on Titan early reveal of the mystery of the giants being originally just normal dudes, totally ruining any existing interest in the story and world for normal people. (Except for the creeps who just like violence and death with bland soap opera.)"
